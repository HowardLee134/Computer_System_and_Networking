## Computer_System_and_Networking

Description:
>The Advanced MIPS Processor Simulator Suite is a comprehensive collection of Python-based projects designed to simulate and analyze various aspects of MIPS processors. This suite encompasses four distinct projects, each focusing on different functionalities and levels of processor simulation.

MIPS Assembly to Machine Language Converter:
>This project features a powerful Python script that converts MIPS assembly code into machine language instructions. By reading assembly code from a specified file, the script meticulously parses and converts the instructions, producing the corresponding machine code. The script is designed to adhere to specific formatting constraints, ensuring accurate translation. Command-line integration using Python argparse facilitates seamless execution.

Single Cycle Processor Simulator (Alpha Implementation):
>The Alpha Implementation of the Single Cycle Processor Simulator simulates the first iteration of a single-cycle MIPS datapath. Following the depicted structure, this Python-based simulator parses a machine-language input file, executes the instructions as depicted in the diagram, and generates the required outputs. The simulator is designed to provide an accurate simulation of the MIPS processor, delivering valuable insights into its behavior and performance.

Single Cycle Processor Simulator (Beta Implementation):
>Building upon the Alpha Implementation, the Beta Implementation further extends the capabilities of the single-cycle MIPS datapath simulator. By incorporating additional features and functionalities, this simulator enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the simulation. It parses both the machine-language input file and the memory file, simulating the instructions as per the diagram and producing the required outputs. The Beta Implementation offers an advanced level of simulation, providing valuable insights into the >behavior and performance of the MIPS processor.

Cache Simulator:
>The Cache Simulator project focuses on simulating the behavior of direct-mapped and n-way set associative caches. Implemented as a Python program, the simulator analyzes memory access sequences, utilizing 32-bit memory addresses for 4-byte word access. By selecting the desired cache scheme, the simulator accurately simulates cache hits and misses, providing valuable insights into cache behavior and performance.
